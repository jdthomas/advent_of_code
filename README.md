# Advent of code WIP

Work in progress submissions for [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## 2020

For 2020 was playing with learning about c++20's ranges (via
[rangev3](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3)) and
[fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt).

## 2021

For 2021, I was hoping to use something new haskell or rust or something
different.. but getting a late start will be using c++ .. again.
